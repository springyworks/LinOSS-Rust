## Testing and Benchmarking

-   `examples/compare_scan_methods.rs`: Verifies that all scan methods produce numerically consistent outputs for the `LinossLayer` given the same inputs.
-   `src/bin/benchmark_scan_methods.rs`: Allows comprehensive benchmarking of these scan methods across different sequence lengths, state dimensions, and backends (NdArray CPU, WGPU GPU).

## Performance Results

### CPU Backend (NdArray)
-   For smaller sequence lengths and state dimensions, the `sequential_scan` often remains competitive or faster due to lower overhead.
-   As sequence length and/or state dimension increases, parallel scan variants (especially tree and work-efficient) can start to show benefits even on CPU, though these are often modest due to the overhead of Burn tensor operations and lack of true multi-core exploitation for the scan logic itself within a single op.

### GPU Backend (WGPU)
-   Parallel scan algorithms (`forward_parallel_scan`, `forward_tree_scan`, `forward_work_efficient_scan`) demonstrate significant speedups over the `sequential_scan` on the WGPU backend, especially for larger sequences and state sizes. This is where the parallelism of these algorithms is effectively utilized by the GPU.
-   The `benchmark_scan_methods` tool confirms this behavior.

## Accuracy Verification

All scan algorithms have been tested (in `compare_scan_methods.rs` and unit tests in `model.rs`) to produce consistent results within typical floating-point numerical precision (e.g., differences < 1e-5 or 1e-6 depending on `f32`/`f64` and sequence length).

## Future Work

1.  **Further GPU Optimization:** While WGPU shows benefits, deeper optimization (e.g., custom WGSL kernels for the associative operator if Burn's composition isn't optimal, or more advanced scheduling) could be explored if specific use cases demand even higher performance.
2.  **Batch Processing Optimization:** Ensure optimal performance for batched inputs across all scan methods, particularly on GPU.
3.  **Memory Optimization:** Profile and reduce temporary memory allocations within the scan algorithms if they become a bottleneck.

## Conclusion

The integration of parallel scan algorithms into the `LinossLayer` provides a flexible and performant way to compute the LinOSS recurrence. Users can choose the scan method appropriate for their hardware (CPU/GPU) and problem size. The WGPU backend, in particular, benefits significantly from the parallel variants. The implementation is robust, with verified numerical consistency across methods.
