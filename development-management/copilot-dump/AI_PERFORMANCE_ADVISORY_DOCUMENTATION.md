# AI Performance Advisory System for VS Code/GitHub Copilot

## üéØ Overview

The AI Performance Advisory System provides intelligent recommendations for optimizing your development workflow based on AI server performance patterns. This system was developed as part of the LinossRust project after identifying that European morning peak hours (08:00-10:00 CET) significantly impact AI service performance.

## üìä Performance Windows

### üü¢ Optimal Windows
- **Weekdays**: 05:00-08:00, 21:00-23:00 (CET)
- **Weekends**: 06:00-22:00 (CET)
- **Characteristics**: Low AI server load, excellent response times
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Ideal for complex AI-assisted development
  - Schedule architecture decisions and refactoring
  - Use advanced Copilot Chat features
  - Perform comprehensive code generation tasks

### üü° Moderate Windows
- **Weekdays**: 10:00-13:00, 15:00-19:00 (CET)
- **All times**: 23:00-05:00 (CET)
- **Characteristics**: Standard AI server load, normal performance
- **Recommendations**:
  - Standard development workflow
  - Regular AI assistance for coding tasks
  - Normal Copilot usage patterns

### üî¥ Peak Windows (Avoid intensive AI usage)
- **Weekdays**: 08:00-10:00, 13:00-15:00, 19:00-21:00 (CET)
- **Characteristics**: High AI server load, reduced performance
- **Recommendations**:
  - Consider pausing intensive AI-assisted development
  - Focus on code review, documentation, or testing
  - Use offline development activities
  - Schedule manual coding tasks

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+ installed
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extensions
- Linux/Unix environment (tested on Ubuntu/Debian)

### Quick Setup
1. The system is already integrated into your workspace
2. All configuration files are in place:
   - `.vscode/copilot-performance.json` - Performance window configuration
   - `.vscode/settings.json` - Enhanced with Copilot settings
   - `.vscode/tasks.json` - VS Code tasks for easy access
   - `ai_performance_advisor.py` - Main advisory script

## üöÄ Usage

### Command Line Interface

#### Check Current Status
```bash
python3 ai_performance_advisor.py --status
```
Shows current performance window, recommendations, and next optimal time.

#### Continuous Monitoring
```bash
python3 ai_performance_advisor.py --watch
```
Runs in watch mode, notifying you when performance windows change.

#### Update VS Code Settings (Preview)
```bash
python3 ai_performance_advisor.py --update-settings --dry-run
```
Shows what Copilot settings would be updated without making changes.

#### Update VS Code Settings (Apply)
```bash
python3 ai_performance_advisor.py --update-settings
```
Applies optimal Copilot settings for the current performance window.

### VS Code Tasks Integration

The system integrates seamlessly with VS Code through pre-configured tasks:

#### Available Tasks (Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task"):

1. **AI Performance Status** - Quick status check
2. **Start AI Performance Monitoring** - Background monitoring
3. **Update Copilot Settings (Dry Run)** - Preview changes
4. **Update Copilot Settings** - Apply changes
5. **AI-Optimized Development Session** - Start optimized workflow

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Performance Window Configuration
Edit `.vscode/copilot-performance.json` to customize:
- Time ranges for each performance window
- Recommendations for each window
- Copilot settings per window
- Timezone settings

### VS Code Settings Integration
The system automatically manages these Copilot settings:
- `github.copilot.enable`
- `github.copilot.chat.enable`
- `github.copilot.advanced.length`
- `github.copilot.advanced.temperature`
- `github.copilot.advanced.listCount`

### Window Title Integration
Your VS Code window title now shows the current AI performance status:
```
filename.rs ‚Üí LinossRust ‚Üí [AI: OPTIMAL]
```

## üìà Performance Insights

### Historical Analysis
Based on extensive testing during LinossRust development:

- **European Morning Peak (08:00-10:00 CET)**: 
  - 2-3x slower AI responses
  - Frequent timeouts and incomplete suggestions
  - Reduced code completion quality

- **Weekend Advantage**: 
  - Consistently better performance
  - 16-hour optimal window (06:00-22:00)
  - Ideal for intensive AI-assisted development

- **Late Evening Sweet Spot (21:00-23:00)**:
  - Excellent response times
  - High-quality code suggestions
  - Optimal for complex refactoring tasks

### Rust/Burn-Specific Optimizations
The system includes special handling for Rust development with the Burn ML library:
- Enhanced context length for complex trait bounds
- Lower temperature for more precise API usage
- Specialized prompting for Burn-specific patterns

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Time Zones
To adapt the system for different time zones:
1. Edit `.vscode/copilot-performance.json`
2. Update the `timezone` field
3. Adjust time ranges in `performanceWindows`

### Project-Specific Settings
Add custom settings for specific project types in the configuration:
```json
"projectSpecificSettings": {
  "rust": {
    "burnLibrary": {
      "enhancedSettings": {
        "github.copilot.advanced.length": 1200,
        "github.copilot.advanced.temperature": 0.4
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Automation Scripts
Create shell aliases for common operations:
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias ai-status="python3 ai_performance_advisor.py --status"
alias ai-watch="python3 ai_performance_advisor.py --watch"
alias ai-update="python3 ai_performance_advisor.py --update-settings"
```

## üîç Monitoring & Alerts

### Status Indicators
- üü¢ **Optimal**: Best time for AI-assisted development
- üü° **Moderate**: Normal development workflow
- üî¥ **Peak**: Consider non-AI tasks

### Automatic Notifications
The watch mode provides:
- Real-time window change notifications
- Time-until-optimal calculations
- Proactive workflow suggestions

### VS Code Integration
- Window title shows current performance status
- Tasks provide quick access to all functions
- Settings automatically adapt to performance windows

## üìö Examples

### Daily Workflow Integration
```bash
# Start your development day
python3 ai_performance_advisor.py --status

# Based on the output, choose your tasks:
# - Optimal: Complex AI-assisted development
# - Moderate: Standard coding with AI assistance  
# - Peak: Code review, testing, documentation
```

### Automated Development Sessions
```bash
# Launch VS Code with performance-aware setup
code . && python3 ai_performance_advisor.py --update-settings
```

### Continuous Integration
```bash
# In CI/CD pipelines, check optimal times for AI-assisted tasks
if python3 ai_performance_advisor.py --status | grep -q "OPTIMAL"; then
    echo "Running AI-intensive tests"
    # Run comprehensive AI-assisted testing
else
    echo "Deferring AI-intensive tasks"
    # Run basic tests only
fi
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### JSON Parse Errors
- Ensure `.vscode/settings.json` contains valid JSON (no comments)
- Use the dry-run mode first to preview changes

#### Python Import Errors
- Verify Python 3.6+ is installed
- Check that the script is run from the project root directory

#### VS Code Task Not Found
- Reload VS Code window (Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window")
- Verify `.vscode/tasks.json` contains the AI performance tasks

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by modifying the script:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
