in deep leaning land and python the data format pkl pikl is used much, is ther a rust crate that read wirtie thos data deeplearning files




Show thinking
Yes, there are Rust crates available for reading and writing the .pkl or .pikl (pickle) data format used extensively in Python for deep learning. However, directly using these for complex deep learning models saved in Python is not always straightforward.

The primary crate for this purpose is serde_pickle. This crate integrates with the popular serde framework in Rust, allowing you to serialize and deserialize Rust structs to and from the pickle format.

Reading and Writing Pickle Files with serde_pickle
serde_pickle provides the functionality to both read from and write to pickle files. For standard data types like integers, floats, strings, and collections (vectors, hashmaps), the process is generally smooth.

Writing to a pickle file:
You would define a Rust struct, derive serde::Serialize, and then use serde_pickle::to_writer to write an instance of your struct to a file.

Reading from a pickle file:
Similarly, you can define a Rust struct with serde::Deserialize and use serde_pickle::from_reader to load data from a pickle file into your struct.

Challenges with Deep Learning Models
The main challenge arises when dealing with deep learning models from libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow, which are often saved as pickle files. These files contain complex, custom Python objects that don't have a direct equivalent in Rust.

Custom Classes: serde_pickle has limited support for deserializing arbitrary Python classes. When a Python object of a custom class (like a neural network model) is pickled, the file stores the class name and its attributes. For serde_pickle to deserialize this, it needs a corresponding Rust struct and a way to map the Python class to it, which is often not feasible for intricate model architectures.

NumPy Arrays: Deep learning models heavily rely on NumPy arrays for storing weights and other numerical data. While serde_pickle can handle basic data structures, it doesn't have built-in support for directly deserializing NumPy arrays into a Rust equivalent like an ndarray array. The typical recommendation is to first convert the NumPy arrays to a more universal format (like a list of lists) within Python before pickling.

Alternative and Complementary Crates
Due to the limitations of serde_pickle for complex deep learning files, other crates and approaches have emerged:

serde-pickle-rs: A more recently maintained fork of serde_pickle that might offer better compatibility with newer pickle protocols.

repugnant-pickle: This crate is specifically designed for "scraping" data from pickle files, especially PyTorch models (.pth or .pt files), when serde_pickle is insufficient. It's not a full-fledged deserializer but can extract tensor data and other information from model files that use features not supported by serde_pickle, such as persistent IDs.

Recommendations for Handling Deep Learning Files
Given the complexities, here's a recommended approach for working with Python-based deep learning data in Rust:

Prioritize Portable Formats: Whenever possible, instead of relying on pickle files, save your deep learning models and data in a more interoperable format. Formats like ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) for models, or HDF5 and Arrow for large datasets, are designed for cross-language compatibility and are well-supported in both Python and Rust.

Convert in Python: If you must use pickle files, do the heavy lifting in Python first. Before pickling, convert complex objects and NumPy arrays into simpler data structures that have clear equivalents in Rust (e.g., nested lists, dictionaries with primitive types).

Use serde_pickle for Simple Data: For exchanging data that consists of basic types, serde_pickle is a very capable and recommended solution.

In summary, while Rust provides tools to interact with the pickle format, the direct application to complex deep learning files from Python requires careful consideration of the data structures involved. For robust and reliable interoperability, transitioning to more standardized formats is often the better long-term strategy.
