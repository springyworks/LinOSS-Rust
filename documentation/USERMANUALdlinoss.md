NAME
     linoss-rust - Linear Oscillatory State-Space Models implementation using Burn framework

SYNOPSIS
     cargo run --example EXAMPLE [--features BACKEND]
     cargo build [--release] [--features BACKEND]
     cargo test [--features BACKEND]

DESCRIPTION
     LinOSS-Rust implements Linear Oscillatory State-Space Models (LinOSS) based on the research
     paper "Oscillatory State-Space Models" (arXiv:2410.03943v2). The implementation focuses on
     real-valued LinOSS-IM (Implicit Time Integration) variant using the Burn framework for
     backend-agnostic tensor operations supporting both CPU and GPU execution.

     The project provides a flexible and efficient Rust library for LinOSS models, suitable for
     research and application development, with emphasis on forced harmonic oscillators and
     parallel scan algorithms for efficient sequence processing.

BACKENDS
     ndarray_backend    CPU-based computation using NdArray (default)
     wgpu_backend      GPU-accelerated computation using WGPU

BUILD OPTIONS
     --release         Build with optimizations enabled
     --features        Select backend (ndarray_backend|wgpu_backend)
