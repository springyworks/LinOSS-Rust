# LinossRust Examples

This directory contains runnable Rust examples demonstrating various features, models, and utilities in the LinossRust project.

## 🌊 Featured: NeuroBreeze - Advanced Brain Dynamics Visualization

**NEW**: Experience the beauty of neural dynamics with our enhanced 3×16 spinning Lissajous intercommunication visualization!

```bash
cargo run --example pure_dlinoss_brain_dynamics
```

**What makes this special:**
- **3×16 Signal Matrix**: Each neural region (🧠PFC, 🌐DMN, ⚙️THL) displays 16 individual intercommunication signals
- **Velocity-Driven Spinning Patterns**: High-velocity signals show as colorful emojis (🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣⚫⚪), medium-velocity as traditional spinning symbols (◐◓◑◒)
- **Real-time Brain Dynamics**: Watch bidirectional neural communication evolve in real-time
- **dLinOSS Architecture**: Three interconnected blocks with different A-matrix parameterizations (ReLU, GELU, Squared)
- **Live Data Streaming**: Neural states stream as JSON to `/tmp/dlinoss_brain_pipe`

This represents the cutting edge of neural simulation visualization, combining mathematical rigor with intuitive, beautiful displays of complex brain dynamics.

### pure_dlinoss_brain_dynamics.rs 🌊
**NeuroBreeze v1.0** - The most advanced neural dynamics visualization in the LinossRust suite.

**Features:**
- **3 Neural Regions**: Prefrontal Cortex (🧠), Default Mode Network (🌐), Thalamus (⚙️) 
- **16 Signals per Region**: Each region outputs 16 distinct intercommunication signals
- **Spinning Lissajous Patterns**: Velocity-driven animation with colorful high-activity indicators
- **Bidirectional Connectivity**: Full 6×6 matrices connecting all dLinOSS blocks
- **Multiple A-Parameterizations**: Fast (ReLU), Medium (GELU), Slow (Squared) blocks
- **Real-time Data Export**: JSON streaming to FIFO pipe for external analysis
- **Interactive Controls**: Pause, damping toggle, coupling strength adjustment

**Technical Details:**
- Based on dLinOSS (Damped Linear Oscillatory State-Space) models
- Three-timescale architecture modeling different neural frequencies
- Ultra-low latency streaming with non-blocking I/O
- TUI-based visualization with activity bars, trajectory plots, and signal matrices

**Usage:**
```bash
cargo run --example pure_dlinoss_brain_dynamics

# Monitor live data stream:
cat /tmp/dlinoss_brain_pipe
```

**Controls:**
- `p`: Pause/unpause simulation
- `d`: Toggle damping on/off  
- `+/-`: Increase/decrease coupling strength
- `q`: Quit

This example showcases the full power of LinOSS models for complex neural system modeling with stunning real-time visualization.
