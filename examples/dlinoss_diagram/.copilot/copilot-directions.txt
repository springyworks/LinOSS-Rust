DO NOT
1. cargo run --release; it takes much longer to compile and link 
2. use the cd command in every other cli command , especialy like this one ; cd <fullpath> && gargo ............ . This very like a sub-cargo proble , with its own bins etc.
3. do not dump all the "Here's what I've implemented for you: ...." , most of the time the result is not satisfactory
