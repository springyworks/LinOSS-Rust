   ```

## Technical Details 🔧

The 404 errors were caused by:
1. References to external CSS/JS files that didn't exist
2. Browser automatically requesting favicon.ico
3. Possible cached references to old file locations
4. Missing unified styling system

**Resolution approach:**
- Created all missing files with proper content
- Ensured WASM module accessible from multiple paths
- Added comprehensive error handling and status checking
- Created user-friendly landing page for navigation

All demos should now work without console 404 errors! 🎉
